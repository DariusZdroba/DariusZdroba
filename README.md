# 👋 About Me

Hi viewer of my GitHub page👋,

since you landed here, I'll briefly introduce myself:

My name is Darius, I currently work at [![Snyk](https://img.shields.io/badge/Snyk-4C4A73?logo=snyk&logoColor=fff)](#) as a Software Engineer and I’m passionate about **Engineering**, **Innovation**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Finance**, with an endless curiosity about how things work. 🛠️  

### This curiosity was part of me my whole life.


I remember as a kid, I was curios about everything, I always took my toys apart just to see what's inside, my innocent mind was trying to comprehend how all of it works.🔧

As a teenager, I became fascinated by technology and PCs, and I started by building my own from spare parts at ~13 yo to enjoy gaming on a budget. 🎮 

This natural curiosity eventually led me to **Software Engineering**, where I’m currently focused, I'm a thinker and like to find and cover edge cases. 💻  



### When I’m not geeking out over tech, 
you’ll find me enjoying or playing **football** and other sports, listening to **music**, or diving into some epic **video games**. ⚽🎶  

Oh, and I’m **23 years old**! 🎉
